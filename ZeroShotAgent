# Documentation: ZeroShotAgent

## Introduction
The **ZeroShotAgent** is an AI agent designed to **answer queries** using a **Language Model (LLM)** and a set of predefined **tools**. It follows a **zero-shot reasoning approach**, meaning it determines the best tool or action to take without prior training on specific task examples.

**Description:** *Construct an agent from an LLM and tools.*

## Properties

### Required Parameters
- **`llm`** (`BaseLanguageModel`):
  - Description: The language model used for processing queries.
  - Required: **Yes**

- **`tools`** (`BaseTool` list):
  - Description: A list of tools the agent can use.
  - Required: **Yes**

### Optional Parameters
- **`callback_manager`** (`BaseCallbackManager`):
  - Description: A callback manager to handle agent events.
  - Required: **No**
  
- **`output_parser`** (`AgentOutputParser`):
  - Description: Parses the agent's output into a structured response.
  - Required: **No**

- **`format_instructions`** (`str`):
  - Description: Instructions for formatting the agentâ€™s responses.
  - Required: **No**
  - Default:
    ```
    Use the following format:
    
    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action
    Observation: the result of the action
    ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
    ```

- **`input_variables`** (`str` list):
  - Description: List of input variables for dynamic agent behavior.
  - Required: **No**

- **`prefix`** (`str`):
  - Description: Introduction message before tool selection.
  - Required: **No**
  - Default:
    ```
    Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:
    ```

- **`suffix`** (`str`):
  - Description: Instruction message before user input processing.
  - Required: **No**
  - Default:
    ```
    Begin!

    Question: {input}
    Thought:{agent_scratchpad}
    ```

### Additional Information
- **Base Classes:**
  - `BaseSingleActionAgent`
  - `ZeroShotAgent`
  - `Agent`
  - `Callable`
- **Display Name:** `ZeroShotAgent`
- **Documentation:** [Langchain Custom MRKL Agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_mrkl_agent)
- **Custom Fields:** None
- **Output Types:** None
- **Beta Status:** `false`

## Usage
The **ZeroShotAgent** follows a **step-by-step reasoning process** to answer queries effectively:

1. **Receives a question** from the user.
2. **Thinks** about what action to take.
3. **Selects a tool** from the available options.
4. **Provides input to the tool** and observes the result.
5. **Repeats the process** if necessary until a final answer is formed.
6. **Outputs the final answer**.

### Example Use Case:
- The agent receives the question:  
  _"What is the weather like in Berlin?"_
- It decides to use the **weather API tool**.
- It sends a request and retrieves **real-time weather data**.
- It **formats the response** and provides the final answer.

## Conclusion
The **ZeroShotAgent** is a flexible and powerful agent that can dynamically **select tools, reason through actions, and generate structured responses**. It is useful for **question-answering, task automation, and AI-driven decision-making**.
